Friend Voice Chat AI — Your Friendly Virtual Companion

This project is a simple web app that lets you have a voice conversation with an AI friend. The AI replies are powered by Google’s Gemini language model, and you can optionally have those replies spoken back using OpenAI’s text-to-speech service.



What It Does

- Listens to your voice through the browser and converts it to text  
- Sends your words to Google Gemini to generate a smart, friendly reply  
- Plays the reply out loud using OpenAI’s TTS (optional)  
- Shows the conversation and status in a clean, user-friendly interface  
- Runs on a Node.js backend that handles API requests and keeps your keys safe
